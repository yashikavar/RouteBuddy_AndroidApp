The project ROUTE BUDDY is designed by keeping in mind the travelling issues of the common man.
Our app will provide a platform where people can find their route partners within 1km of circle and can devise a method 
of carpooling by which a lot of travelling expenditures are cut down and is an eco-friendly strategy too. Users can specify their
daily route which enables them to find their daily route partners. They can also find their instantaneous route partners which means 
they can always pool no matter where they have to go.
